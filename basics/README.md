People ask me what I do, I say that I write code and poetry. Their next sentence is usually "show me". Aaaand that is where the problem begins because I then have to go through my files in under 5 minutes before they lose interest. So I decided to make this website which I can point people to so that they can find me and give me much required social attention.
